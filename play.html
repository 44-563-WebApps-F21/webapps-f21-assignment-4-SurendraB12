    <pre>
             <h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6><P class="speech"> Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that? </p>
      

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6><p class="speech">  Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6> <p class="stage-direction">[_Taking off his left-hand glove_.] </p>   <p class="speech" >What a pity!  I beg
your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that.  But if what you
tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
Lady Chiltern.</p>
 
<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6> <p class="speech" > It would be quite useless.</p> 

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6> <p class="speech" > May I try?</p> 

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6>  <p class="speech" >Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views. </p>

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6>  <p class="speech" > Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
experiment.</p> 

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6>  <p class="speech" > All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p> 

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6>  <p class="speech" > Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn’t so,
life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
you should have told her years ago.</p> 

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6>  <p class="speech" > When?  When we were engaged?  Do you think she
would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?</p> 

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Slowly_.]</p>  <p class="speech" > Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There
is no doubt of that.</p> 

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Bitterly_.] </p>  <p class="speech" >Men who every day do something of
the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
in their own lives.</p> 

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6>   <p class="speech" >That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
people’s secrets.  It distracts public attention from their own.</p> 

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6>   <p class="speech" >And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?  No
one.</p> 

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Looking at him steadily_.] </p>  <p class="speech" >Except yourself, Robert.</p> 

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_After a pause_.]</p>  <p class="speech" > Of course I had private
information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
the day, and I acted on it.  Private information is practically the
source of every large modern fortune.</p> 

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Tapping his boot with his cane_.] </p>  <p class="speech" >And public scandal
invariably the result.</p>
