<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6> <P class="speech"> But tell me, Robert, did you never suffer any regret for
what you had done?</P>

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6>  <P class="speech">No.  I felt that I had fought the century with its
own weapons, and won.</P>

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Sadly_.] </p> <P class="speech">You thought you had won.</P>

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6>  <P class="speech">I thought so. </P> <p class="stage-direction"> [_After a long pause_.] </p>
<P class="speech"> Arthur, do you despise me for what I have told you?</P>

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_With deep feeling in his voice_.]</p> <P class="speech"> I am very sorry for
you, Robert, very sorry indeed.</P>

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6> <P class="speech"> I don’t say that I suffered any remorse. I had a wild hope that I might disarm
destiny.  The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have distributed twice over in
public charities since then.</P>

<h6 class="LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Looking up_.]</p> <P class="speech"> In public charities?  Dear me! what a lot
of harm you must have done, Robert!</P>

<h6 class="SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIRROBERTCHILTERN</h6> <P class="speech"> Oh, don’t say that, Arthur; don’t talk like that!</P>
